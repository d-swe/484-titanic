#### Note: As Jupyter Notebook version control on Github is rather difficult, some of the additional preliminary models and data exploration reside on different branches labeled accordingly.

Dive into the genius of our predictive model, a cutting-edge marvel sculpted with unmatched precision and analytical might. Harnessing vast datasets from the Titanic's fateful voyage, we've mastered the art of foresight, unraveling the intricate patterns of survival with an accuracy that defies belief. Experience the future of predictive analytics, where history, data, and technology converge to resurrect the ghostly tales of the Titanic and foretell destinies once lost in the depths of the icy Atlantic.
